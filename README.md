# TAMU_SRT

## Description
This repository contains the work I have done on the Texas A&M University Soudning Rocketry Team. At my time on TAMU SRT, I have developed guidance, navigation, and control algorithms for a 500 lb rocket-powered lander and a 5 lb sub-scale model. The autopilot is tested on the electric subscale vehicle, where the control laws and filters are validated before use on the main vehicle.
