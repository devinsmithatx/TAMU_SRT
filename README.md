# TAMU_RED

## Description
This reprository contains the work I have done on the Texas A&M University Soudning Rocketry Team. At my time TAMU SRT, I have developed guidance, navigation, and control algorithms for a 500 lb rocket-powered lander. The autopilot is tested on an electric subscale vehicle, where the control laws and filters are validated before use on the main vehicle.
